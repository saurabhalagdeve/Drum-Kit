## Introduction
The Drum Kit is a fun and interactive web application that lets you experience the joy of playing drums without the need for any physical instruments. Whether you are a musician, a drum enthusiast, or just looking to have some musical fun, this project is perfect for you.

## Usage
To start playing the drums, simply open the [Drum Kit](https://your-drum-kit-url) in your web browser. You'll see a set of drum buttons on the page, each associated with a specific key. You can either click on the buttons using your mouse or use the corresponding keyboard keys to trigger the drum sounds.

Here are the keys and their corresponding drum sounds:

- `w` - Snare
- `a` - Tom 1
- `s` - Tom 2
- `d` - Tom 3
- `j` - Hi-Hat
- `k` - Crash
- `l` - Kick

Feel the rhythm and enjoy creating your beats!

## Installation
You don't need to install anything to run the Drum Kit. Simply clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file. Then, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser, and you're good to go!

## How It Works
The Drum Kit is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main functionality of detecting button clicks and keyboard presses to produce drum sounds is handled by the `index.js` script.

## Styling
The visuals and appearance of the Drum Kit have been designed with CSS. The `styles.css` file contains the following styling properties:

- The `body` has a centered text alignment and a dark background color (#283149).
- The `h1` element has a large font size (5rem), a custom cursive font-family ("Arvo"), a text color (#dbedf3), and a text-shadow effect (3px offset with a pink color #da0463).
- The `footer` element has a sans-serif font-family and a text color (#dbedf3).
- Each drum button (`.drum`) has a circular shape, a thick border (#404b69), a large font size (5rem), a custom cursive font-family ("Arvo"), a bold font weight (900), a text color (#da0463), and a text-shadow effect (3px offset with a white color #dbedf3).
- The `.pressed` class is applied when a drum button is clicked or pressed, giving it a box shadow effect and reducing its opacity.
- The `.red` class changes the text color to red.

The drum buttons also have unique background images associated with their respective sounds.
